                <h4>Protection of personal data</h4><br />
                <p>
                    Certain parts of the stealthguarding.co.za website (hereinafter referred to as the “Website”) collects users' personal data, but only if users provide these voluntarily. The Website facilitates the exchange of product and/or service offers from the service providers to those Users who request such offers (“the Service”); and the Service is not possible without the Website forwarding the Users’ data to third parties. Nonetheless Stealth Guarding & VIP Protection (Pty) Ltd the owner and operator of the Website (“Stealth Guarding & VIP Protection”) will endeavour to protect the User’s personal information as required by data privacy legislation applicable to it.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <h4>Do you want to submit a request for a quote. What data about you do we collect?</h4><br />
                <p>
                    The Users who submit a request for a quote on the Website are hereinafter referred to as “Users”.<br /><br />

                    When submitting a request for a quFote, Users will be asked to give us (Stealth Guarding & VIP Protection) some personal information, e.g. full name, telephone number, email address, and information about the required products and/or services and technical data. In some cases, when this is a prerequisite for preparing a quote, you will also be asked to tell us your home address or the location to which the quote relates. Some data is stored while the data is being filled into a form. The Website uses cookies. Cookies technically enable the submission of the request for a quote on the Website and help advertise our Website. By using the Website you agree to all of the above.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <h4>What is technical data?</h4><br />
                <p>
                    Technical data comprise the data about your IP address, operating system and the web browser you use to access the Website. Technical data will not be collected.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <h4>You have submitted a request for a quote. To whom do we forward your data?</h4><br />
                <p>
                    The data you provided on our quote Request Form is sent to the Providers that provide products and services via stealthguarding.co.za (“Providers”) you requested, but only after you have requested and confirmed such request as follows:<br /><br />

                    When you submit a request for a quote on stealthguarding.co.za and fill in the data you are willing to give us we will contact you and verify your request.<br />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h4> When may a Provider use your data?</h4><br />
                <p>
                    For the purpose of preparing a quote and/or concluding a business deal with a User, including the preparation of any written contract or terms of engagement and the like.<br />
                    Each Provider undertakes that they will not under any circumstances forward the Users’ personal data to other users or third parties, unless they are obliged in law to do so or this is necessary for the purpose of preparing a quote. The same applies for other (non-personal) data that is contained in the request for a quote.<br />
                    Natural persons’ data is not shared with other companies and we do not sell them to data processors that have no connection to the products or services you ordered.<br /><br />

                    Only if required by the courts or governing authorities will your data be forwarded to the appropriate national authorities or courts.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <h4>Provider’s Undertakings</h4><br />
                <p>
                    All Providers undertake towards Stealth Guarding & VIP Protection and the User:<br /><br />

                    To use and store the Users’ data acquired through the Service in accordance with the Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act and all other applicable regulations.<br />
                    to use the Users’ data exclusively for the purpose of preparing a quote and/or concluding a business deal with the User.<br />
                    under no circumstances to forward Users’ personal or any other information received from Stealth Guarding & VIP Protection to other Users or any third party, unless the same is necessary for the purpose of preparing a quote and/or concluding a business deal with the User. The Provider also undertakes that it shall not forward any other information contained in the Lead to any third party, unless legally required to do so.<br />
                    to respect the following rights of Users:<br />
                    The right of access to the data managed by the Provider.<br />
                    The right of rectification of User data.<br />
                    The right of deletion of User data.<br />
                    The right of processing limitation.<br />
                    The right of User data portability.<br />
                    Cookies and services in use<br />
                    As almost all websites, the Website uses cookies as well. A cookie contains a sequence of letters and numbers; it is loaded on your computer when you visit a website.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <h4>Our cookies: Why we use them:</h4><br /><br />
                <p>
                    For purposes of the basic website operation (submitting requests for quote, registration, inspecting offers).<br />
                    We save your sign-up; the cookie ensures you do not have to sign-up every time you visit the Website.<br />
                    We modify the Website according to a User’s needs.<br />
                    Third party cookies<br />
                    As most websites, we use third party cookies. Without them, we would not be able to measure the quality of services and marketing which would likely render our service non-operational.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <h4>Why we use them:</h4><br /><br />
                <p>
                    Statistical analyses of website visits.<br />
                    Website testing.<br /><br />
                    Which third party services are we using?<br />
                    Almost every website uses “analytical tools”. Stealth Guarding & VIP Protection.co.za might in the future use Google Analytics to analyse website visit and statistics. This tool does not recognize data about individual persons, it will however help us when measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. <br />

                    In some cases, we wish to change the Website, but we are not sure how Users will react. To determine this, we would use testing tools (Google optimize) which only shows these changes to a small percent of Users. Based on the results we decide whether the change is worth adopting.<br />
                    <br />
                    When we wish to show a map with the location of a Provider or User, we use the Google maps service.<br />
                </p>
                <h4>For sending emails, storing data, backups, and website hosting we use the following services of data processors:</h4><br />
                <p>
                    You will receive messages ifyou have submitted a request for quote. We could notify you of offers our Providers sent you, about User testimonials, services connected to your request for a quote, and complementary services. We could send you links to Provider profiles and testimonials about them on the Website, and request you to review Providers you used. All notification that you receive will be related to your request for a quote or the stealthguarding.co.za service.<br />
                </p>
                <h4>Request for deletion of personal data</h4><br />
                <p>
                    If you are no longer interested in the Services, you may contact us at any time via email and request that we stop sending you communication. You may also request your data to be deleted, rectified or transmitted once we have started saving them. We do not currently save your data, this may change within the folowing months.<br />
